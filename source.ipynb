    "The social issue I am trying to address is the the Right to Repair Movement. The growing probelm at hand is in the modern construction and design of new vehciles today, being made so the average mechanic or even DIYer cannot work on or repair their own car without taking it to the manufacturer for speaclized work. By is a growing problem in the modern automotive industry as newer cars become more and more complex and complicated to work on and repair. With modules upon modules to service and scan that require dealer-only diagnostic equipment and software, this prevents many car owners from DIYers to small independent shops from servicing and working on their cars without taking them to the expensive dealership.

With the technological shift from mechanically driven, simple, and easy to work on cars that were once software dependent, have raised modern day repair costs and resticted consumer choice. The right to repair movement offers a solution to the growing complexity of modern construction automobiles by leveling the grounds between the big name dealerships and independent shops and DIYers, reducing the costs of repairs and giving vehicle owners a choice in where to service their vehicles.
